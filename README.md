# 🚕 Uber Ride Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **Uber ride request data** to identify patterns in demand, location-based trends, and service gaps.  
It uses **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** for data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization.

**Objectives:**
- Analyze ride request patterns by time and location
- Identify peak demand periods
- Check ride status distribution (Completed, Cancelled, No Cars Available)
- Provide actionable insights to improve service efficiency

---

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (hour, day, time slot extraction)  
- Visualizations (count plots, stacked bar charts, heatmaps)  
- Insights and recommendations based on data trends

## 📁 Dataset
Columns in the dataset:
- `Request id`
- `Request timestamp`
- `Drop timestamp`
- `Pickup point` (City or Airport)
- `Status` (Completed / Cancelled / No Cars Available)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Run the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Uber_Ride_Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb
```

---

## 📈 Results / Insights
- Morning (7–9 AM): High demand and cancellations from City to Airport  
- Evening (5–8 PM): Many "No Cars Available" at Airport  
- Drop timestamps are mostly missing for cancelled or no‑car rides

**Suggestions:**
- Increase driver availability during morning peaks at Airport
- Improve supply in evenings at Airport
- Use demand forecasting to rebalance driver supply

---

## ✨ Future Improvements
- Add predictive modeling for demand forecasting
- Build a Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration
- Automate periodic reporting
